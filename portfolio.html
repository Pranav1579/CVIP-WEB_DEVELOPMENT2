                    <h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>
                    <p>As a Machine Learning Intern, where I acquired valuable skills in the field. I delved into various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Clustering. One notable project involved applying Logistic Regression to predict house prices based on factors such as square footage, number of rooms, and bathrooms. This experience enhanced my proficiency in data prediction and analysis within the realm of machine learning.

                    <h2>Forest Fire Detection</h2>
                    <p>The most common hazard in forest fires are accident as the forest
                      themselves destroys the forests and can be great threat to wild life and
                      peoples. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the physical device which is
                      used to connect, store and enable the objects to collect information for
                      exchanging the data through the internet based system. The main
                      objective of paper is to predict the developing trend of the fire by
                      monitoring temperature, humidity, etc.</p>
